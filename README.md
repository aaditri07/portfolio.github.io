Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠 Projects

###Urban Agriculture

OVERVIEW:  

Urban agriculture is the practice of cultivating, processing, and distributing food within urban areas. It includes various activities like rooftop gardens, community gardens, vertical farming, and hydroponics. Urban agriculture helps enhance food security, reduce the urban heat island effect, and promote sustainable urban development by utilizing available city spaces for food production. It also fosters community engagement and reduces the carbon footprint associated with transporting food from rural areas.
Technical Stack:  

- Languages: C++, Java  
- Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques  

Impact:  

Urban agriculture has several significant impacts:

1. Food Security: Enhances local food availability, reducing dependence on external food sources and increasing resilience against supply chain disruptions.
2. Economic Benefits: Creates jobs, supports local businesses, and can reduce food costs for urban dwellers.
3. Environmental Impact: Reduces food miles and carbon emissions, improves urban biodiversity, and can contribute to better waste management through composting and recycling organic waste.
4. Social Impact: Strengthens community ties, provides educational opportunities, and promotes healthier eating habits by increasing access to fresh produce.
5. Urban Aesthetics and Climate: Enhances urban green spaces, mitigates the urban heat island effect, and can improve air quality.
6. Land Use: Maximizes the use of underutilized urban spaces, such as rooftops and vacant lots, contributing to more efficient land use in cities.
